<h2>Charges</h2>

For users who would like to use the platform only to buy from sellers in their neighbourhood, would not be charged for the platform services.</p>

<p>Users who would like to sell products/services on the platform should be aware that it would cost currently &ldquo;1 Re per (order line/order item)&rdquo; captured on their behalf by the platform. These charges are collected via a pre-paid subscription similar to many of the mobile company&rsquo;s pre-paid plans.</p>

<p>Sellers would need to keep their account with the platform with adequate order line credit balance by precharging their account from time to time. Once the order-line-credit-balance  runs out, i.e becomes zero, buyers would stop finding you and your products on the platform until the account is recharged and maintains positive balance.</p>
