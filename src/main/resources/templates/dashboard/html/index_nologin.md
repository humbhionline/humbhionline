#Hum Bhi Online 
->-Boosting the digital economy from the grass roots!<-

A refreshingly Indian market place that is inclusive in its approach to all round community growth, "Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavanthu". 



##Just 1&#x20b9;/OrderLine!.

Humbhionline provides its services(order capture,record pack,record delivery,payment capture) over a prepaid model. You can (re)charge your account with humbhionline with as low an amount as 1&#x20b9; e.g. If you recharge for 10&#x20b9; and buy credits for 10 orderlines. You will continue to receive orders from customers till you receive a total of 10 order lines. When across all your customers, the number of orderlines serviced reaches 10, you are taken offline (i.e not suggested to customers any more)  till the account is recharged. It is that simple. 

** Wondering how come so low price? **

Yes market places generally charge a percentage on order amount. We believe this is not fair to the small business owners. We recognise that even a small percent of the order amount is a big percent of the profit margin thus creating a huge entry barrier for small business owners in taking their business online. We realize that the cost to us (technology providers) is not a function of the value of the orders captured, then why should our pricing be value based. So we chose to set our price as function of our cost.  We believe that over time, as more sellers join the humbhionline movement, we could even go down to 50ps/orderline and still be profitable.

When there is no balance left in the account, your account would go offline and is not suggested to the buyers. Once the account is recharged, you would be automatically online again ready to take orders.
