#HumBhiOnline 
->- Boosting the digital economy from the grass roots!<-

A refreshingly Indian market place that is inclusive in its approach to all round community growth, "Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavanthu". 

##Why Another marketplace?
Most marketplaces take a percentage of the invoice amount as their fee. This fee is usually a sizable percentage of the profit margin, making it un-affordable for these small sellers. Additionally, these market places take money from the customer and hold it for 2-3 days causing small sellers to deal with lower working capital. 

**"HumBhiOnline"** was created to remove this entry barrier for small sellers. It is critical for the digital economy to thrive, that India's small sellers adopt online strategies for their businesses. 

##Why choose HumBhiOnline?
1. Provides a convenient buying option to your buyer, who you are currently losing to other online players. 
1. Get More customers.
1. Accurate order capture than your current text messages or phone based tracking that are prone to mistakes. 
1. Get digital payments via UPI without sharing your upi each time via text/sms thus reducing mistakes in typing.
1. Provide electronic bills to your customers - avoiding paper this being more responsible and eco-friendly. 
  


### 1&#x20b9;/OrderLine
HumBhiOnline provides its services(order capture,record pack,record delivery,payment capture) over a prepaid model. You can (re)charge your account with humbhionline with as low an amount as 1&#x20b9; e.g. If you recharge for 10&#x20b9; and buy credits for 10 orderlines. You will continue to get orders from buyers till 10 order lines (in total) are booked with you. When across all your customers, the number of orderlines booked against you reaches 10, you are taken offline (i.e not suggested to customers any more)  till the account is recharged. It is that simple. 

### Wondering how come so low price? 
As we already explained, market places generally charge a percentage on order amount. We believe this is not fair to the small business owners. We recognise that even a small percent of the order amount is a big percent of the profit margin thus creating a huge entry barrier for small business owners in taking their business online. We realize that the cost to us (technology providers) is not a function of the value of the orders captured, then why should our pricing be value based. So we chose to set our price as function of our cost, (Server costs, data carrying costs etc getting distributed within the seller community)  We believe that over time, as more sellers join the HumBhiOnline movement, we could even go down to 50ps/orderline and still be profitable.

HumBhiOnline's commitment is in providing a world class platform at a price that covers our running costs. We want a marginal profit that would be enough for us to keep it going, hiring, etc. This platform is created post my retirement. So I am not in this to make money for myself. I have enough for that. This is my way of contribution to the country through my skills acquired in my active work life in supplychain and information technology.
