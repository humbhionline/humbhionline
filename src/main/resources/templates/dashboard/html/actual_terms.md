## Charges

Users availing services of the platform either play the role of Buyer or Seller at a transaction level. Sellers in one transactions may be Buyers in another and vice versa. For users who would like to use the platform only to buy from sellers in their neighbourhood, would not be charged for the platform services.

As a User, who would like to sell products/services on the platform, you would need to buy pre-paid humbhionline credits. These credits are sold in packs of 50, 100 etc. and are deducted as and when orders are successfully booked against you as a seller. For each item included in an order irrespective of the  quantity and price, your humbhionline credit's balance would be reduced by 1. 


for e.g, If you receive an order for 2 Kg Rice and 5Kg Wheat, 2 credits will be deducted from your humbhionline credit balance as there were 2 items included in the order, namely Rice and Wheat. 

If for any reason, an entire item is removed/cancelled from an order, your credit balance would be increased by 1. 


Sellers would need to keep adequate credit balance by precharging their account from time to time. Once the humbhionline credits run out, i.e becomes zero, buyers would stop finding you and your products on the platform until the account is recharged and a positive balance is maintained.
