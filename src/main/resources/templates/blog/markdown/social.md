## Covid the disrupter

Covid has been a great disrupter for entire humanity. I have seen farmers learning to sell grapes and mangoes using messaging apps. Some of my friends at our apartment complex started making food for people falling sick with covid. There were people volunteering with procuring medicines for the sick patients, volunteering to walk people's dogs and what not. Watching communities come together to support each other in such trying times has been emotionaly touching for me. 

## Rise of online shopping (boon or bane?)
It was during these times, Online shopping also increased several folds with lockdown etc playing their part. While this has been a boon to the buyers in these trying times, it had also created a huge disruption in business for  local small sellers. Many shops closed down (some temporarily, some permanently) ,  Our ironing man who used to iron clothes lost his livelihood as people started working from home and were not ironing clothes as frequently.

## Restoring livelyhood of local communities
I tried asking some of the sellers who were fighting to survive, how are they managing? 
1. Many sellers selling essential commodities/services had turned to messaging apps to take orders and keep business afloat. 
2. Some started doing batched deliveries. 
3. Tied up with hyperlocal delivery folks to do deliveries.
4. They wanted tools that would make their order capture , delivery booking etc easier to manage. since messaging apps was difficult to do manage manually.

Thats when I thought, Is there any thing I could put my supply chain knowledge and software expertise to better use and put our local seller community back on their feet and have our community thrive again?

## Current options available with local Sellers.
1. Create your own digital store 
	- Using tools like shopify/magento/woocommerce/wix/bigcommerce/mydukaan/storehippo.., you can create your digital presence easily. 
	- Then you need to attract customers to your sites requiring reasonable marketing spend in ads and SEO. 
	- This spend needed to be done for each shop wanting to go online. 
1. Join a market place. 
	- Joining established market places reduces your marketing spend.
	- High cost of returns and high commissions reducing the margins making it not attractive for small sellers. 
1. Do your business by messaging platforms. 
	- Whatsapp and messaging platforms have helped the small sellers in being a float but fundamentally it is not very convinient to 
		+ Share catalog	 (Sharing products, their  price and photo is too tedious and doing the same for  each buyer wastes a lot of time for the seller.)
		+ Make invoices	 (You need to manually create totals)
		+ Take payments. (you need to share upi with each buyer each time or have your delivery boy collect Cash.)

## HumbhiOnline - Mandi

An affordable and inclusive, refreshingly Indian, market place, that buyers and sellers love. 


## How are we different? 
1. Users of the platform can be buyer, seller or delivery agent based on their role on a transaction. This makes it easy for retailer to buy from wholesalers or home enterprenur who normally buy from retailers to also sell their craft on the platform. 
2. Direct payment between parties.
3. Prepaid Credits purchased by sellers (@ rate of 1 Re per credit) are deducted on order bookings @ very nomimal rate of 1 Credit/Ordered Item. 
4. Buyer or Seller can organize delivery by themselves, through humbhionline registered delivery agents or using 3rd party courier partners. 
5. HumbhiOnline is a social venture with intention to rejuvenate livelihood of people in local communities by making it easy for sellers to go online and retain their local customers, it's pricing is cost based rather than value based. We continously work on keeping the cost of running the platform low.
