# HumBhiOnline Community Edition
## An open source market place software.

[HumBhiOnline](https://humbhionline.in) is an open source marketplace platform tailor made for small sellers and home enterprenurs in India. It is built on top of the [Succinct Web Framework](https://github.com/venkatramanm/swf-all).

If you like to start selling right away, you can use the hosted application [here](https://humbhionline.in) or download the [android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.humbhionline) from google play store

If however, you would like to self host your own personal marketplace with your customized android or ios app, you can do that too but would involve more work.  If you need help with self hosting or would like to host your marketplace as a subdomain of humbhionline to leverage on this social movement, please contact [support@humbhionline.in](mailto:support@humbhionline.in) to work out the details.
